# Python Modules

This project is about learning how to use Python modules. A module is a file that contains Python code. Modules can be used to organize your code and to make it easier to reuse code.

## Resources

* [Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
* [Command line arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
* [Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [python3](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/python3/python3.10.html)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* How to import functions from another file
* How to use imported functions
* How to create a module
* How to use the built-in function `dir()`
* How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
* How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.

You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.

You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks

* Create a module called `my_module.py`.
* In `my_module.py`, define a function called `hello()` that prints the string "Hello, world!".
* Import the `my_module` module into a new file called `main.py`.
* In `main.py`, call the `hello()` function.
* Run `main.py` and verify that the output is "Hello, world!".

## Submission

* Submit the following files to your GitHub repository:
    * `my_module.py`
    * `main.py`
    * `README.md`

## Good luck!
